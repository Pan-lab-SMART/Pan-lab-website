  abstract: "Urate, the physiological form of uric acid and a potent antioxidant in\
    \ serum, plays a pivotal role in scavenging reactive oxygen species. Yet excessive\
    \ accumulation of urate, known as hyperuricemia, is the primary risk factor for\
    \ the development of gout. The high-capacity urate transporter GLUT9 represents\
    \ a promising target for gout treatment. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy\
    \ structures of human GLUT9 in complex with urate or its inhibitor apigenin at\
    \ overall resolutions of 3.5\u2009\xC5 and 3.3\u2009\xC5, respectively. In both\
    \ structures, GLUT9 exhibits an inward open conformation, wherein the substrate\
    \ binding pocket faces the intracellular side. These structures unveil the molecular\
    \ basis for GLUT9\u2019s substrate preference of urate over glucose, and show\
    \ that apigenin acts as a competitive inhibitor by occupying the substrate binding\
    \ site. Our findings provide critical information for the development of specific\
    \ inhibitors targeting GLUT9 as potential therapeutics for gout and hyperuricemia.\n"
