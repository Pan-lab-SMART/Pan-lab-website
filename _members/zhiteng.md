Zhiteng obtained his Ph.D. in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from Sun Yat-sen University, where he received rigorous training in X-ray crystallography for protein structure analysis and drug screening. To broaden his expertise in structural biology, he joined Dr. Pan’s lab in December 2023. Currently, Dr. Luo focuses on the structure and physiological functions of the SLC family—a diverse group of membrane transporters with various biological roles. Zhiteng brings extensive experience in protein structural biology (including both X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy), backed by a solid foundation in organic chemistry. As an amiable and self-driven researcher, he warmly welcomes new members to his group, fostering an environment of mutual growth and development.
Outside the lab, Zhiteng plays for the SMART basketball team and is known for his all-around skills—both offensive and defensive. Thanks to his impressive performance both in science and on the court, he has earned several legendary titles, including “Dominator of the 4°C Room,” “Dr. ZUI,” and “Basketball Hoop Destroyer.”
